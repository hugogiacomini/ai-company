# AI Company Simulation

A sophisticated simulation of a real software development company with **dual-backend support**: **CrewAI** for traditional sequential orchestration and **Claude Code** for custom subagents with parallel execution. The system implements a complete organizational hierarchy with CEO, CTO, Department Heads, Experts, Developers, Analysts, and more.

## 🏢 Overview

This project simulates a full-featured AI-powered company with:

- **Complete Organizational Hierarchy**: From C-level executives to junior staff
- **Multiple Departments**: Marketing, Operations, HR, Software Development, Commercial
- **Intelligent AI Agents**: Each agent has specific roles, expertise, and responsibilities
- **Realistic Workflows**: Cross-functional collaboration, product launches, quarterly reviews
- **Dual Backend Support**: Choose between CrewAI or Claude Code custom subagents
- **Parallel Execution**: Claude Code backend supports concurrent agent workflows

## 🔧 Backend Options

### CrewAI Backend (Default)
- Traditional sequential agent orchestration
- Stable and production-ready
- Requires OpenAI API key

### Claude Code Backend
- Custom subagents defined in `.claude/agents/` markdown files
- Supports parallel task execution
- Runs within Claude Code environment
- 16 specialized subagent definitions included

**See [BACKEND_GUIDE.md](BACKEND_GUIDE.md) for detailed backend documentation.**

company.display_organizational_chart()
```

### Run a Department Workflow

```python
from company import AICompany, Department

company = AICompany()

# Marketing campaign
result = company.run_department_workflow(
    Department.MARKETING,
    campaign_goal="Launch new AI product"
)

# Software development
result = company.run_department_workflow(
    Department.SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT,
    feature="User authentication system"
)

# HR recruitment
result = company.run_department_workflow(
    Department.HUMAN_RESOURCES,
    focus="talent acquisition"
)
```

### Run Cross-Functional Scenarios

```python
# Product launch (involves multiple departments)
company.run_product_launch("AI Assistant Pro")

# Quarterly business review
company.run_quarterly_review("Q4 2024")

# Strategic planning session
company.run_strategic_planning("2025 Annual Strategy")
```

### Run Example Scenarios

```bash
# Show organizational structure
python src/examples.py --show-structure

# Run specific scenario
python src/examples.py --scenario 1  # Marketing campaign
python src/examples.py --scenario 2  # Software development
python src/examples.py --scenario 3  # HR recruitment
python src/examples.py --scenario 4  # Product launch
python src/examples.py --scenario 5  # Quarterly review
python src/examples.py --scenario 6  # Strategic planning
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### Hierarchical Organization
- Realistic company structure with reporting relationships
- Clear role definitions and responsibilities
- Skills and expertise mapping for each role

### Intelligent Agents

- Agents can delegate tasks based on hierarchy
- Specialized expertise in their domain

### Flexible Task System
- Pre-defined task templates for common scenarios
- Customizable task parameters
- Support for complex workflows

### Department Crews

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Roles

Edit `src/company/models/hierarchy.py` to add new roles to the organizational chart:

```python
Role(
    title="New Role Title",
    level=RoleLevel.EXPERT,
    department=Department.MARKETING,
    reports_to="Head of Marketing",
    responsibilities=["Responsibility 1", "Responsibility 2"],
    skills=["Skill 1", "Skill 2"]
)
```

### Creating New Agents

Add agent factory methods in `src/company/agents/company_agents.py`:

```python
@staticmethod
def create_new_agent() -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        role="New Agent Role",
        goal="Agent's goal",
        backstory="Agent's backstory",
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False
    )
```

### Defining Custom Tasks

Add task creation methods in `src/company/tasks/company_tasks.py`:

```python
@staticmethod
def create_custom_task(agent, context: str) -> Task:
    return Task(
        description=f"Task description with {context}",
        agent=agent,
        expected_output="Expected output description"
    )
```

## 📊 Example Output

When you run a workflow, you'll see detailed execution logs showing:
- Agent reasoning and decision-making
- Task execution progress
- Inter-agent collaboration
- Final deliverables

## 🔒 Environment Variables
